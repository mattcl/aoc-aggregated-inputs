# Day 4 benchmarks

[link to problem](http://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4)

The following benchmarks are auto-generated via [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) by a ci system running on shared hardware. Results may be inaccurate, particularly for execution times < 5ms, as per the hyperfine warnings.

The "official" inputs were aggregated from repositories participating in the generation of these benchmarks. The "large" inputs (if any) were sourced from various places, including the subreddit.

## Benchmarks with officially generated inputs
| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `lanjian/day_04 input-lanjian` | 4.8 ± 0.9 | 3.2 | 14.9 | 1.35 ± 0.35 |
| `lanjian/day_04 input-mattcl` | 4.3 ± 0.7 | 3.5 | 11.0 | 1.22 ± 0.28 |
| `mattcl/004_giant_squid input-lanjian` | 3.5 ± 0.6 | 2.5 | 11.1 | 1.00 |
| `mattcl/004_giant_squid input-mattcl` | 3.7 ± 0.4 | 2.7 | 6.6 | 1.03 ± 0.21 |
## Benchmarks using unofficial large inputs
| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `lanjian/day_04 large-input-01` | 306.6 ± 12.3 | 284.4 | 322.5 | 2.25 ± 0.24 |
