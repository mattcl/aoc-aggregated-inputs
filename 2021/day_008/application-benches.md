# Day 8 benchmarks

[link to problem](http://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8)

The following benchmarks are auto-generated via [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) by a ci system running on shared hardware. Results may be inaccurate, particularly for execution times < 5ms, as per the hyperfine warnings.

The "official" inputs were aggregated from repositories participating in the generation of these benchmarks. The "large" inputs (if any) were sourced from various places, including the subreddit.

## Benchmarks with officially generated inputs
| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `lanjian/day_08 input-lanjian` | 15.0 ± 1.3 | 13.0 | 22.1 | 3.40 ± 0.53 |
| `lanjian/day_08 input-mattcl` | 14.4 ± 1.2 | 12.1 | 21.1 | 3.26 ± 0.50 |
| `mattcl/008_seven_segment_search input-lanjian` | 4.7 ± 0.6 | 3.1 | 7.5 | 1.05 ± 0.20 |
| `mattcl/008_seven_segment_search input-mattcl` | 4.4 ± 0.6 | 3.3 | 7.7 | 1.00 |
## Benchmarks using unofficial large inputs
| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
